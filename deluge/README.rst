Docker Deluge-Web
==========================

This is a Dockerfile to set up deluge-web with an OpenVPN client attached
through PrivateInternetAccess.com_.

I've made several changes to @firecat53's original file, including removing
pipework_, which also led me to rewrite pia_deluge_monitor in bash.

Original Upstream README
==========================

This is a Dockerfile to set up deluge-web with an OpenVPN client attached
through PrivateInternetAccess.com_ and managed with pia_deluge_monitor You need
to have a network bridge (br0) already setup on the host, because pipework_ is
used to establish the connection so the container can have it's own IP address
on the network. This also avoids any port forwarding/open port issues.

Build
-----

First edit the files in private_example and rename private_example to private.
Set the user and group in config.ini as which deluge will run. It is not
normally required, but if you are planning on allowing remote access to the
Deluge daemon, you should edit private/deluge/auth to add a username and
password like::

    <user>:<password>:10

I had to add the "::10" in this file because the web client wasn't able to talk
to the daemon by default otherwise. It's more simple, but **less secure if you
enable remote access**.

Then build from Dockerfile::

	docker build -rm -t deluge .

Create data-only configuration volume and chown the directory to your intended
user UID::

    docker run -v /config --name deluge_config scratch true &> /dev/null
    docker run --volumes-from deluge_config ubuntu chown -R <UID>:users /config

If desired, create a data-only volume for your media. You can also just mount a
directory on the host with the '-v' option instead of using --volumes-from::

    docker run -v /data --name media_data scratch true &> /dev/null
    docker run --volumes-from media_data ubuntu chown -R <UID>:users /data

Install pipework_ on the host.

Running the container
---------------------

Docker >= 1.2: the --cap-add=NET_ADMIN flag has to be used so that the tun
device can be created. ::

    docker run -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --net=none --volumes-from deluge_config --volumes-from media_data --name deluge_run deluge

Docker < 1.2: the --privileged flag has to be used so that the tun device can be
created. ::

    docker run -d --privileged --net=none --volumes-from deluge_config --volumes-from media_data --name deluge_run deluge

Use pipework to assign a static IP address to the container (Note: br0 is
existing bridge on the host system). The IP must have the CIDR, should be in the
same network address space as the host, and you must specify the gateway (should
be the same as the host uses)::

    # pipework br0 deluge_run <ip address>/24@<gateway ip>
    # (example) pipework br0 deluge_run 192.168.0.123/24@192.168.0.1
    where the gateway is 192.168.0.1, the host IP address might be
    192.168.0.101, and the deluge container address is 192.168.0.123

Make sure set the correct path for your torrent downloads in the preferences
before you start downloading. Otherwise the default is /root/ and you will get
permission errors.

Systemd service file is also available.
